![Fake News Detector](https://www.tradoc.army.mil/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PG-25_fake-news-hero-imgv2.png)
## Project Overview

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect fake news. The goal is to build a model that can distinguish between genuine news articles and those that are misleading or false. By analyzing the text content of news articles, our system aims to identify patterns and features indicative of fake news.

## Introduction

Fake news is a significant problem in the modern digital age, leading to misinformation and confusion. This project uses advanced NLP techniques to analyze and classify news articles, helping users identify fake news. The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleansing and preparing the text data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction:** Using techniques such as TF-IDF, word embeddings, and NLP-specific features to extract meaningful information from text.
- **Model Training:** Training various machine learning models to classify news articles.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of news articles labeled as fake or real. It includes a diverse range of sources and topics to ensure a comprehensive analysis. The dataset is preprocessed to remove any irrelevant information and ensure consistency.

## Installation

This project uses:

- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using 'pip':

```bash
pip install .
```

You can also install them using 'poetry':

```bash
poetry install
```


## Usage

### Using Docker

This project provides a docker-compose.yml file to run the project in a docker container. To run the project in a docker container, follow these steps:

```bash
docker-compose up

### Using Python

After installing the dependencies, you can run the project as follows:

1. **Preprocess the data:**

   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

2. **Train the model:**

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Evaluate the model:**

   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

4. **Make predictions:**

   ```bash
   python predict.py --input sample_news_article.txt
   ```

## Model Architecture

The project explores various NLP models, including:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **Deep Learning Models (e.g., LSTM, BERT)**

The architecture involves transforming text data into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings, followed by training the models to classify the news articles.

## Evaluation

The performance of the models is evaluated using standard metrics:

- **Accuracy:** The proportion of correctly classified articles.
- **Precision:** The proportion of true positives out of all positive predictions.
- **Recall:** The proportion of true positives out of all actual positives.
- **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## Results

The results of the model evaluations are documented in the `results` directory. The best-performing model is selected based on the evaluation metrics and further fine-tuned for optimal performance.
